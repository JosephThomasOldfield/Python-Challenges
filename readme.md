## Python Challenges ##

This document outlines some Python challenges I have completed. To run the challenges enter
"python3 documentname.py" into the console. This acts as my introduction to python and many of its 
concepts!

### Challenge 1: ###

Create a variable called password.
Check how many letters are in the password, if there are less than 8 log to the console that the password is too short. Otherwise log the password to the console.

### Challenge 2: ###

Create a variable called num.
Check if the variable is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is log “This number is divisible by 3 or 5” to the console. Otherwise log “This number is not divisible by 3 or 5”.

### Challenge 3: ###

Create a variable called num.
If num is divisible by 3 log “fizz” to the console, if it’s divisible by 5 log “buzz” to the console, if it’s divisible by both 3 and 5 log “fizz buzz” to the console. Otherwise log num to the console.

 ### Challenge 4: ###

Create a function that takes a number as a parameter and adds one.

### Challenge 5: ###

Create a function that takes two numbers and an operator as parameters. It should return a print out of the sum e.g. “1 + 2 = 3” or “4 x 6 = 24”.

 ### Challenge 6: ###

Create a function that takes two strings as a parameters and returns the strings concatenated.

 ### Challenge 7:  ###

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

 ### Challenge 8: ###

If I add up the digits of the number 19082 I would get 1+9+0+8+2=20. Add the digits of the number: 371072875339021027987979982208375902465101357402504637693767749000971264812489697007 805041701826053874324986199524741059

 ### Challenge 9: ###

Calculate the number of days till Christmas.

 ### Challenge 10: ###

Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns a random number between them.

 ### Challenge 11: ###
 
Write a function that given a radius returns the circumference of a circle. (2 * π * radius)
